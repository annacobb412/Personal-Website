  If I \*had\* to describe myself in three words, they might be "I'm probably hungry". If I had to describe myself in more, I'd say: I'm a second year PhD candidate in the engineering and public policy department at Carnegie Mellon University. Though my time here has been filled with moments of intense self-scrutiny and uncertainty, it has also included some really beautiful moments during my classes and research. I really like what I'm doing here.
  
  More specifically, my current research project investigates service quality discrepancies of Uber and Lyft across racial groups. Generally, I'm interested in researching issues at the intersection of society and engineering, like consumer adoption of electric vehicles and understanding the impacts of the energy transition on historically marginalized communities. Luckily, I get to hear about these topics frequently during presentations to the [Vehicle Electrification Group (VEG)](https://www.cmu.edu/cit/veg/index.html), the research group run by my advisor, Dr. Jeremy Michalek, which I am a part of.
  
  Outside of research and coursework, I spend my time in Pittsburgh bouldering, listening to podcasts, and spending time with my lovely fellow students. If you are interested in learning more about my professional and academic experiences OR the failures I've experienced along the way, please see my [resum√©s](/resumes/).
