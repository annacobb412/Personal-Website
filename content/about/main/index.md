  If I \*had\* to describe myself in three words, they might be "I'm probably hungry". If I had to describe myself in more, I'd say: I'm a rising fourth(!!) year PhD candidate in the engineering and public policy (EPP) department at Carnegie Mellon University. Though my time here has been filled with moments of intense self-scrutiny and uncertainty, it has also included some really beautiful moments during my classes and research. I really like what I'm doing here.
  
  My PhD research has covered a range of topics: I began with work [investigating the presence of inequities in ridehailing services](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2408936121), but my last couple of projects have focused on understanding how to manage electric vehicle batteries once they can no longer be used in a vehicle. (Current harmonizing title of my thesis will be something about investigating the major trends of transportation). Generally, I'm interested in researching issues at the intersection of society and technology, especially as it relates to capturing and communicating the uncertainties and nuances associated with these problems--fortunately, this is what the EPP department is all about. I get to hear about these kinds of problems and the wonderful people solving them during presentations to the [Vehicle Electrification Group (VEG)](https://www.cmu.edu/cit/veg/index.html), the research group run by my advisor, Dr. Jeremy Michalek, which I am a part of.
  
  Outside of research and coursework, I spend my time in Pittsburgh bouldering, listening to podcasts, and spending time with my partner and lovely fellow students (mostly also while bouldering, but occasionally at other social events :grinning:). If you are interested in learning more about my professional and academic experiences OR the failures I've experienced along the way, please see my [resum√©s](/resumes/).
