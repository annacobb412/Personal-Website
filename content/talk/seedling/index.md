title: "Agent-Based Modeling"
subtitle: "An Introduction"
excerpt: "This was a talk I gave at a student-led workshop hosted by GROW+ (Graduate Organization of Womxn), an organization specific to the department of engineering and public policy (EPP) at Carnegie Mellon. The workshop was focused on exposing other graduate students in the department to methods commonly used in EPP research, like agent-based modeling (my topic), GIS and spatial data analysis, and conducting interviews for qualitative analysis."

Below are the slides I presented, which were tuned for students from my department who are required to take several courses as a part of the EPP curriculum: namely, 19-701: Introduction to the Theory & Practice of Policy Analysis. This course briefly introduces agent-based modeling, but doesn't go into significant detail.
