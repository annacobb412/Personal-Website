greater second-life potential than nickel-cobalt
batteries"
excerpt: "These are slides I presented at a Volta Foundation webinar (the Battery Forum on BESS, to be specific) about my work on EV battery second life. Notably, this work was a collaboration with researchers from Carnegie Mellon, NREL, and ANL. My talk was recorded and posted here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD7r0wxEuRk."
