title: "Using the Bridges 2 Supercomputer"
excerpt: "This is a talk I gave on the basics of supercomputing and using the Bridges 2 supercomputer at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Using Bridges 2 to run simulations has been instrumental to my first research project and by enabling unique features like OnDemand and creating handy resources like the Bridges 2 User Guide, it doesn't take that long to get started!"
