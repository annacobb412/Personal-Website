title: "A Technoeconomic Analysis of Repurposing EV Batteries"
excerpt: "This is a poster I made (my first as a graduate student!) to talk about the research I've done on EV battery repurposing. I made this poster about two thirds of the way through the project, so some things have definitely changed, but it does a good job of explaining our main finding: the economics of repurposing have a lot to do with the battery's chemistry."
