Since ChatGPT reached people who were not AI experts or superfans--the release date was November 30, 2022--I've been wondering about its use in schools. I am very far from the only person to be thinking about this, but the topic of using technology to cheat has been on my mind since coming across the website [Chegg.com](https://www.chegg.com/) in my undergrad.

There are three questions I'm looking to answer or provide some insight on:
+ Did or does OpenAI have any sort of plan for regulating the use of ChatGPT to complete homework assignments or exams? Have any of the other companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, ?) working on large language models (LLMs) thought about this?
+ Is ChatGPT just a calculator for writing and thus something teachers should be redesigning their assignments to accomodate?
+ What are the limits of ChatGPT for answering homework problems?

Chegg: which came first 

Before getting to ChatGPT, I'll start with Chegg. For those who don't know, Chegg is an "edtech" company which states its mission as "to help every student achieve their best, in school and beyond." To do this, the company offers tools on their website including reduced-price textbooks, a citation generator, a grammar checker, and a "math solver". Oh, and for a small subscription fee ($14.95/month), Chegg Study allows students to copy their homework questions into a search bar and get a fully worked-out solution written by one of the many STEM experts working at Chegg (in India). Relatedly, the math solver the company offers will give students three answers per day to simple math questions for free--unlimited solutions with work shown are available for \$9.95/month.

While I don't have any experience with the math solver, I will say that Chegg was used heavily by students in my undergraduate cohort at Georgia Tech. And I'd be lying if I didn't say that after staring at a problem I didn't understand for some amount of time (the amount being dependent on how much work I had that week or how much I cared about the subject), I didn't google my problem word-for-word and cross my fingers that one of the Chegg expert answers had been leaked for those without a subscription. And--there's no way to say this without sounding like a jerk--I'm one of the most academicallly honest people I know.

Anyway, Chegg Study has been around since 2016, but it really took off during the COVID-19 pandemic (as can be seen by tracing the company's [stock price](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CHGG:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7xYqsu-CEAxV2OUQIHUu9DhkQ3ecFegQIIRAX) over the last 5 years). I'd also like to note here that as pressure continues to build for students to clear increasingly high bars at increasingly high speeds, I'd expect the demand for Chegg to correspondingly increase. Though I haven't taken any classes in anthropology or neuroscience, my experience gives me no reason to believe my generation is any smarter than my parents'. Thus, if asked to achieve more in the same amount of time, other tools besides the human brain are sought out.

Chegg has taken a few steps to mitigate cheating on the platform, but I personally find them ridiculously weak, although that makes sense given how they make money. As this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2021/01/28/this-12-billion-company-is-getting-rich-off-students-cheating-their-way-through-covid/?sh=5b7dae77363f) sums up very nicely, Chegg Study is one of the first instances of technology making it seamless (or at least cheap) for students like myself to cheat.

ChatGPT:

Now onto ChatGPT. So I'll start by answering the first question I was curious about: did OpenAI have any sort of plan for helping teachers control its use for cheating? Was it a thought that entered their minds before they made the product publicly available?
