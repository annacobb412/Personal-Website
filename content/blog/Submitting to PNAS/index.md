As someone who came straight from undergrad into a PhD, it is safe to say that I knew very little about publishing papers when it came time to submit my first research paper. Yes, I managed to get my name on a paper published at a conference through my undergraduate research (shout out to the both genius and kind graduate student that I worked with, as well as the lab's research scientists). But I was fairly detached from the logistical part of the publication process and very minimally exposed to the world of journals and peer review and impact factors.

While I can't pretend to be some sort of expert now, I have gone through the process of submitting to PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) [at the time this article is being written, acceptance is still up in the air]. In deciding to submit to PNAS, which is a prestigious, multi-disciplinary journal, I also did a little bit of research on the publication world in general, which I will try to summarize as well. Below, I start wide and then narrow in on PNAS---note that most of the information I have below is a mixture of what's already posted on the PNAS website + my own thoughts and opinions (which I want to make clear are definitely influenced by my own limited experience and the thoughts and feelings of my advisor).

### Submitting to PNAS 
#### Is your paper of "broad interest"?
I think it's fair to say that PNAS has a unique focus as compared to what I've heard called "trade journals". Whereas these trade journals are very focused on a specific subject or industry (one example might be the journal [Analytical Methods in Accident Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/analytic-methods-in-accident-research), which publishes papers that advance statistical methods for studying vehicle crashes), PNAS publishes papers of "broad interest". I like to think of broad interest as meaning the results of the paper could be interesting to anyone, regardless of their expertise. One consequence of this is that if you write a paper whose findings are important, but not necessarily revolutionary or interesting to people outside your field, it's less likely to get accepted to PNAS[^1]. For example, if you set out to test the validity of a long-used method for detecting breast cancer and your finding is that the method works well, maybe that gets published in a trade journal. If your finding was instead that the method doesn't work well for women of certain demographics and has resulted in under-diagnosis in this group for years, you'd be more likely to get accepted to PNAS. 
#### Styling your paper for PNAS
If you feel your paper is a good topic/findings fit for PNAS, then you should definitely submit there. I'll preface everything I'm about to say with the fact that PNAS is format-neutral at submission, meaning they have no requirements for the format of your paper, except that it includes a title page, abstract, significance statement (this is a unique thing to PNAS), main text, references, and an SI as applicable. However, if you're interested in playing mind games with reviewers/PNAS member editors (subtly influencing them with your very limited power), I think submitting your paper with the following things implemented can help your chances: 
1) trimmed down to their preferred length (6 pages, but they'll accept up to 12)
2) with the content formatted in a broad-interest-style
3) using the PNAS [LaTex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-preparing-your-research-report-submission-to-pnas-using-overleaf-2023/whbdryzwztnd) or Word template [lowest time required] 

As you may have guessed, implementing those three style suggestions takes time, and while I wish I had enough data to construct a pareto frontier quantifying the time invested in styling vs. likelihood of acceptance tradeoffs, I do not. So take what you want from this list based on what you think is worth it. 

Elaborating slightly more on 2): PNAS papers tend to have relatively short methods sections---usually a page or less (though of course it depends on the field and methodology used). The focus of the papers, in terms of how they are written for PNAS, tends to be more on the results and discussion, which makes sense given the broad interest nature of the journal. This of course connects to 3); when you are looking to cut content or move things to the SI, I think it makes the most sense in this case to move methodological details.
