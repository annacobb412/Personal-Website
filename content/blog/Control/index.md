I just watched a video on youtube that I really didn't like. It was a day-in-the-life style video made by a beautiful girl in her early twenties who appears to regularly publish running and Christian lifestyle content. What I absolutely hated about the video was how happy, yet orderly and controlled, it was. A beautiful sunrise during a 6 AM, 10-mile run, playful music while eating precisely two eggs after said run and a gym session, 

What bothers me about this is that if I had seen it in high school, I would have absolutely eaten it up. At that time in my life, I craved perfection and control. In school, in sports, and, most of all, in how I ate. Seeing this beautiful girl, who loves running and fitness and has a heavily-featured, attractive fiance--seeing that she could achieve all this by getting up at 6 AM to go for a 10-mile run, then go to the gym, then eat a tiny breakfast--that would've been the biggest source of confirmation for me. Confirmation that if I just disciplined myself hard enough, I could achieve anything I wanted. 

There is just something so darn appealing about that idea. That if you work hard enough, you can get whatever you want. I mean, that's literally the American Dream. So why do people like me take it and use it to try and control ourselves so intensely, to the detriment of our physical and mental health? Is that just some manifestation of the human condition? 

I think this is pretty common for a lot of vlogs that young women make--I'm fairly out of touch with this sort of thing, so that may be an incredibly obvious statement and it may be true for more demographic groups of vlog-makers than just young women.
